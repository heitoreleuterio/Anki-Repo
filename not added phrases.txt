"Merchants must be wary of their customers"
"hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need"
"Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin"
"A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership."
"common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending."
"The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions"
"To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly announced"
"we will need to use a proof-of-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts."
"The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making"
"The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it"
"If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains"
"To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes"
"To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases."
"The tie will be broken when the next proof-of-work is found and one branch becomes longer"
"As long as they reach many nodes, they will get into a block before long"
"The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended."
"The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees."
"He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth."
"As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network"
"Although it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a separate transaction for every cent in a transfer"
"Normally there will be either a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two outputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender."
"It comprises the fundamental mathematical properties of computer hardware, software, and certain applications thereof"
"In studying this subject, we seek to determine what can and cannot be computed, how quickly, with how much memory, and on which type of computational model"
"I know that many of you are looking forward to studying this material but some may not be here out of choice."
"To see that theory is neither arcane nor boring, but instead quite understandable and even interesting, read on"
"Theoretical computer science does have many fascinating big ideas, but it also has many small and sometimes dull details that can be tiresome"
"My primary objective in writing this book is to expose you to the genuinely exciting aspects of computer theory, without getting bogged down in the drudgery"
"Of course, the only way to determine whether theory interests you is to try learning it."
"What you learned about grammars in this course comes in handy"

"I wish to thank the teachers who helped shape my scientific viewpoint and educational style. Five of them stand out"
"To make up for the loss of the solved problems as interesting homework challenges, I’ve also added a variety of new problems"
"In my view, the role of finite automata here is for students to explore a simple formal model of computation as a prelude to more powerful models, and to provide convenient examples for subsequent topics"
"Of course, some people would prefer a more thorough treatment, while others feel that I ought to omit all references to (or at least dependence on) finite automata"
"Technological advances since that time have greatly increased our ability to compute and have brought this question out of the realm of theory into the world of practical concern"
"Say that you need to arrange a list of numbers in ascending order"
"In one important achievement of complexity theory thus far, researchers have discovered an elegant scheme for classifying problems according to their computational difficulty"
"First, by understanding which aspect of the problem is at the root of the difficulty, you may be able to alter it so that the problem is more easily solvable"
"Second, you may be able to settle for less than a perfect solution to the problem"
"During the first half of the twentieth century"
"It seems like a natural for solution by computer because it lies strictly within the realm of mathematics"
"Among the consequences of this profound result was the development of ideas concerning theoretical models of computers that eventually would help lead to the construction of actual computers."
"In complexity theory, the objective is to classify problems as easy ones and hard ones;whereas in computability theory, the classification of problems is by those thatare solvable and those that are not"
"The next two Venn diagrams depict the union and intersection of sets A and B."
"Hence (7, 21, 57) is not the same as (57, 7, 21)"
"Thus (7, 7, 21, 57) is different from both of the other sequences, whereas the set {7, 21, 57} is identical to the set {7, 7, 21, 57}"
"is the set of all ordered pairs wherein the first element is a member of A and the second element is a member of B"

"coldzera will depart Legacy in the coming days, according to a report by Dust2.com.br which has been confirmed by HLTV sources"
"Now, let’s prove by induction the correctness of the formula used to calculate the size of monthly payments of home mortgages"
"When buying a home, many people borrow some of the money needed for the purchase and repay this loan over a certain number of years."
"Each element will appear in half of the subsets. For instance, in the given example, the element 'a' appears in 32 subsets, 'b' in 32 subsets, and so forth. Let's assume we have defined all the sets in which 'a' is a member. When we do the same with 'b', it also defines 32 sets in which 'b' is a member, but half of these sets are duplicated because 'a' is also a member. Removing the duplicate sets leaves us with only 16 sets. 'b' is a member of 16 sets that 'a' is not. The same pattern repeats with 'c'. By removing the duplicates (i.e., removing the sets that contain 'a' and 'b'), 'c' becomes a member of 8 new sets. Continuing this process until all members are considered, 63 exclusive subsets will be defined. The only subset missing is the empty set. Each new element added to the set doubles the number of subsets, which is represented as 2^c"
"Next, when you want to prove a statement or part thereof, try to get an in-
tuitive, “gut” feeling of why it should be true."
"The bitcoin protocol can encompass the global financial transaction volume in all electronic payment systems today"
"The blockchain is a gossip protocol whereby all state modifications to the ledger are broadcast to all participants"
"It is through this “gossip protocol” that consensus of the state,everyone’s balances, is agreed upon"
"Visa, it would result in outright collapse of the Bitcoin network, or at best, extreme centralization of Bitcoin nodes and miners to the only ones who could afford it"
"This centralization would then defeat aspects of network decentralization that make Bitcoin secure, as the ability for entities to validate the chain is what allows Bitcoin to ensure ledger accuracy and security"
"Having fewer validators due to larger blocks not only implies fewer individuals ensuring ledger accuracy, but also results in fewer entities that would be able to validate the blockchain as part of the mining process, which results in encouraging miner centralization"
"In extreme cases, this manifests as individuals sending funds to centralized trusted custodians who have full custody of customers’ funds. Such arrangements, as are common today, create severe counterparty risk"
"While it is possible that Moore’s Law will continue indefinitely, and the computational capacity for nodes to cost-effectively compute multi gigabyte blocks may exist in the future, it is not a certainty"
"For bitcoin to succeed, it requires confidence that if it were to become extremely popular, its current advantages stemming from decentralization will continue to exist"
"If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"
"The above quote questions the relevance of unobserved events"
"Micropayment channels[3][4] create a relationship between two parties to perpetually update balances, deferring what is broadcast to the blockchain in a single transaction netting out the total balance between those two parties"
"netting out the total balance between those two parties"
"Like the age-old question of whether the tree falling in the woods makes a sound, if all parties agree that the tree fell at 2:45 in the afternoon, then the tree really did fall at 2:45 in the afternoon"
"Either party may do so, but they may elect to instead hold onto that transaction, knowing that they are able to redeem funds whenever they feel comfortable doing so. By deferring broadcast of this transaction, they may elect to change this balance at a future date"
"The output for this Funding Transaction is a single 2-of-2 multisignature script with both participants in this channel, henceforth named Alice and Bob"
"This can only be enforced if one is able to ascribe blame for broadcasting an old transaction"
"Outputs are tied to transaction identifiers (TXIDs), which are the hashes of signed transactions"
"but if the inputs exceed the value of the outputs, any difference in value may be claimed as a transaction fee by the Bitcoin miner"
"Bitcoin requires that each block prove a significant amount of work was invested in its creation to ensure that untrustworthy peers who want to modify past blocks have to work harder than honest peers"
"if the data is modified in any way and the hash re-run, a new seemingly random number is produced"
"If it took fewer than two weeks to generate the 2,016 blocks, the expected difficulty value is increased proportionally (by as much as 300%) so that the next 2,016 blocks should take exactly two weeks to generate if hashes are checked at the same rate"
"In the absence of other considerations, discussed below, nodes usually use the first block they see"
"Later soft forks waited for a majority of hash rate (typically 75% or 95%) to signal their readiness for enforcing
the new consensus rules"
